- 希特勒
	- 反对统一的国家课程
		- During the Nazi Germany period, Hitler's regime attempted to shape the minds of the younger generation by taking control of the education system.

	- 避免历史教训重蹈覆辙
		- The historical events of Hitler launching World War II have provided us with profound lessons and useful references. This action resulted in the loss of millions of lives and worldwide destruction, highlighting the dangers of unilateral pursuit of expansion and hegemony. By reflecting on this dark history, modern policymakers should be alert to the dangers of nationalism and hatred incitement, and keep in mind the importance of international law and the spirit of cooperation to avoid repeating the same mistakes again and shape and maintain a peaceful and stable international order.

- 马丁路德金Martin Luther King
	- 需求创造政治领袖
		- Throughout American history, the black community has always faced severe social oppression and discrimination. These pressures create a strong need to improve one's social status in order to escape the long-standing denial of their equal rights. Out of this environment emerged outstanding leaders, such as Martin Luther King, Jr., who worked to address neglected needs in society through nonviolent means and civil protest.

	- 不光有需求，还需要能力
		- The status of black people has never been high, and the demand to improve the status of black people has existed from the beginning. However, it did not progress until the emergence of Dr. King because the leadership and public speaking ability of the people in front were insufficient, and there was no way to unite more black people

	- 个人的伟大成就可以被当代人决定
		- Franklin D. Roosevelt adopted a series of policy measures during the Great Depression of the 1930s, known as the "New Deal." These policies are designed to respond to economic distress through federal intervention, including measures such as establishing a social security system, regulating financial institutions, promoting public works projects and labor rights. The New Deal changed the role of the U.S. government in economic and social affairs. It was considered an important policy initiative at the time and had a positive impact on the United States. Franklin D. Roosevelt's "New Deal" is widely credited with helping the United States survive the Great Depression.

- 林肯废除奴隶制
	- Take Lincoln's abolition of slavery as an example. Although Lincoln's actions are considered noble, social concepts at the time did not always support the abolition of slavery. Many people may not have stood on the side of the abolition movement because factors such as social concepts and economic interests at the time affected people's attitudes. Therefore, even if there are such political leaders who make positive changes, the vast majority of people in society will not necessarily immediately follow this idea.
- 温斯顿丘吉尔Winston Churchill
	- 历史的重要性名言
		- "The farther back you can look, the farther you are likely to see"
	- 即使有丑闻但仍然是英雄
		- Winston Churchill was a political leader who led Britain against Nazi Germany. In the eyes of the British, he was a hero of his era. However, Churchill's bad temper was famous in both political and military circles. He sometimes acted forcefully in meetings, causing friction with colleagues and subordinates. His political opponents took advantage of this through the media.
- 高斯：
	- 高斯自学与兴趣：
		- Carl Gauss is considered one of the greatest mathematicians and his contributions to the fields of mathematics and physics had a profound impact on modern science. As early as his school days, he showed a special interest and talent for mathematics. He taught himself to read mathematical works and solve various mathematical problems. Part of the reason why he was able to achieve such outstanding achievements was that he was able to focus on his deep interest in mathematics and continue to study it in depth through self-study.
		  id:: 65b0d711-9b6e-4d19-a7ae-e4c31b9e8c7d
	- 高斯没有选择高薪职业
		- Gauss did not choose to pursue "high-paying fields" from the beginning of his academic career. His research areas include mathematics, physics, statistics and astronomy. If he only pursues short-term economic returns at that time, he may choose an area that is popular at the time or has direct economic benefits. However, he chose to pursue his interests and inspire creativity in areas that would later bring him great fame and profound impact on society.
		  id:: 65b0d78a-7b80-44fb-bd65-a5ccd4ab1cb7
		- Gauss's example shows that a single career selection criterion may not fully capture a person's full potential. Education should be a place to cultivate students' all-round development, not just to pursue short-term financial gain. By stimulating students' interest in a variety of subjects, educational institutions can produce more creative and diverse skills that can make more profound contributions to society and the economy in the long term.

- 乔布斯：
	- The co-founder of Apple, Steve Jobs. At a young age, Jobs was found to have a keen interest in electronics and mechanics. However, after only six months at the university, he chose to drop out because he felt that a traditional university education could not meet his needs and interests. He participated in "liberal arts education" to learn what truly interested him. Jobs' talent and innovative spirit eventually found its full expression in the creation and design of Apple's products.

- 奥巴马
	- 经济援助，支持国家免学费
		- Barack Obama is one of the former presidents with remarkable achievements in American history. Barack Obama lived in a relatively poor family during his childhood and adolescence. His mother was a single mother and he grew up in difficult situations. However, through hard work and scholarships, Obama managed to get into Harvard Law School. Without the scholarships and financial support, he might not have been able to pursue a such high education and achieve his dreams. Free college education policy helps eliminate the possibility of students from poor families giving up higher education due to financial reasons and provides them with the opportunity to realize their potential.

- 苏格拉底
	- 个人的伟大有时需要后世决定，并传承发扬
		- The great ancient Greek philosopher Socrates. During his time, Socrates had a profound impact on philosophy, ethics, and politics. His thoughts clashed with the Athenian society at that time, and he was eventually accused of blasphemy and corrupting youth, sentenced to death and drank a poisoned cup. However, as time went by, Socrates' thoughts gradually became recognized and became one of the important figures in the history of Western philosophy. His critical thinking methods, pursuit of wisdom and virtue, and his defense of free speech all had a profound impact on later philosophy and democratic politics. Even today, Socrates' ideas still inspire people's pursuit of truth and justice. Socrates' value and achievements transcend the environment of the ancient Greek era in which he lived, and his thoughts have had an eternal impact on human spiritual civilization.

- 环境保护：
	- 内蒙古的沙尘暴：
		- The sandstorm problem in Inner Mongolia is a case in point. Over the past few decades, with increasing urbanization and industrialization, grasslands in some areas have been overgrazed, leading to land degradation and desertification. This makes it easy to form dust storms when the wind blows during the dry season, which negatively affects local ecosystems and human health.
- 自动驾驶
	- 这个领域不能依靠前人经验，因为没有
		- For example, in the field of autonomous driving, people thought it was a fantasy at first, and people may be uneasy about the concept of having a vehicle drive itself without being controlled by a human driver. Since this is a brand new field, researchers have no past experience to draw from and can only innovate and explore with new sensing technologies, artificial intelligence algorithms, and hardware equipment. But we have now achieved something and have launched pilot projects for self-driving cars in some cities and regions.

- 嬉皮士通过自身特点塑造社会形象
	- Self-shaping: An individual's identification with a social group is not a one-way influence, but can also shape the image of the social group through his or her own behavior, values and choices. This two-way interaction means that our self-definition is not entirely passively dictated by social groups.

	  -eg The hippie movement emerged in the 1960s and became a symbol of the counterculture and peaceful protest of the time. Hippies created a strong social image through their behaviors, values, and choices. They advocated opposition to traditional moral standards, the pursuit of personal freedom and peace, and demonstrated concern for environmental protection and social justice. It turns out that there was no such social group, but the characteristics of the hippies at the time shaped this social group.

- 美国民权运动-质疑促使社会进步
	- The American Civil Rights Movement is a good example. In the 1960s, many Americans questioned the apartheid system and unequal treatment, and challenged the authority of the government and society at the time through demonstrations and other forms of protest. This movement ultimately led to the enactment of the Civil Rights Act, which dismantled many racial segregation policies and secured greater equality and justice for all Americans. This example shows that when many people question the authoritative system of the day and seek change, the well-being of the entire society is improved.

	- The profound meaning hidden in the work may not be understood by the vast majority of people, which is affected by the reader's experience and cultural level. For example, regarding Shelley's famous saying "Winter has come, can spring be far behind?" uneducated farmers may think this sentence is meaningless nonsense, because they may not understand the profound connotation and the symbolic meaning contained in it.

		- The Stanford Prison Experiment is a classic example. In this experiment, participants were assigned the roles of "prison guards" and "prisoners" and were asked to play the corresponding roles. The results showed that these normally normal college students showed obvious changes in their environment. The "prison guards" display cruel and oppressive behavior, while the "prisoners" display obedience and fear. This experiment revealed the behavioral changes that people may have under certain circumstances, emphasizing the profound impact of the surrounding environment on people's attitudes and behaviors.

	- During World War II, some people chose to die rather than surrender, and would rather be tortured than betray their motherland. A famous example is Jean Moulin, a member of the French Resistance. Moulin was one of the leaders of the French resistance organization. After being captured by the Nazis in 1943, he insisted on keeping his mouth shut and refused to disclose any information about the resistance organization to the enemy. He eventually died after being tortured. This attitude of loyalty and tenacity demonstrates unyielding loyalty to the motherland.
