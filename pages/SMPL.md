- Skinned Multi-Person Linear
- a learned model of human body and shape, a skinned vertex based model
- Motivation & Goal
	- different shapes, pose deformations, including soft-tissue motion
	- render fast, deploy easily, compatible
- Current Method's Limitation
	- traditional: hand rigging, artists sculptured->manual efforts
	- learning statistics: scans are not compatible with graphic softwares
- LBS's issue & Solution
	- issue: “taffy” and “bowtie” effects
	- others solution: skinning methods / learn from data / triangle deformations(realistic)
	- ours solution: additively combined with a rest template with different blend shapes for identity, pose, and soft-tissue dynamics
- parameters
	- rest pose template
	- blend weights
	- pose-dependent blend shapes
		- a linear function of the elements of the pose rotation matrices
		- because elements of rotation matrices and resulting deformations are bounded,  model better generalize
	- identity-dependent blend shapes
	- a regressor from vertices to joints locations
