- Why do most children find it difficult to make decisions?
  collapsed:: true
	- i don't really know if it's difficult for children to  make decisions but since this is how the question is asked, we'll have to approach it from this angle and find possible explanations for it
	- the lack of relevant experience or information to refer to: children are still at a stage where they are exploring new things and trying to figure out how things work. as adults we might draw upon from the consequences of successes or failures in the past to elicit principles or patterns that can be applied in the current situation, which are obviously in many children's knowledge base. this might make them feel uncertain or overwhelmed by the choice in front of them
	- cognitive skills: children are mentally immature and still developing their cognitive skills. as we know during the process of decision-making, we need to have the ability to process information, evaluate options and foresee consequences. this is not something that can be easily acquired without a rather developed mind
	- many children haven't really understood or accepted the concept of trade-offs. as we grew up, we gradually learned the idea that sometimes we just have to choose one thing at the expense of another. it's a lesson challenging for not only children but also a lot of adults to learn. we often see children who want all the toys in front of them, not willing to share any of them with others. they are indecisive simply because they want all the toys and don't know which one to give up
	- some adults are still facing similar problems as children are, and the process of reflecting on their behaviors is like looking ourselves in the mirror, which offers us more insights into who we are and why we are the way we are

	- well, you can say they are just ambitious, competitive or hard working, but i don't think sacrificing too much personal life for work is a wise choice
	- people who are empty or bored may not like holidays, this kind of people probably don't have any hobbies to pass the time or they don't have any close friends or family to spend their time with. so comparing to suffer from boredom or loneliness, they'd rather put their time and energy into work
	- poor financial situations: some people are just struggling so hard to improve their financial status and holidays mean that they can earn some extra money probably at a much higher rate. so sometimes people prefer working to taking holidays just to ease the financial burden on their shoulders, especially for the breadwinners of their family
- what benefit can people get if they are self-centered
  collapsed:: true
	- people-pleasers, socially accepted, immediate personal gain
	- firstly when being self-centered, people may achieve more immediate personal gain. To be specific, by putting their own interests at first they can maximize their financial wealth, material possessions and career opportunities
	- secondly, it provides mental benefits, such as less rumination and stress since this kind of people have the guts to follow their hearts and don't really worry about other people's judgments. this can in some way, contribute to their self-confidence and emotional well-being.
	- thirdly, being self-centered means they can be more concentrated on their personal ambitions and desires. this kind of single-minded focus on personal success can help them gain greater achievements and realize their full potential.
- why do people make decisions?
  collapsed:: true
	- life consists of all kinds of decisions that we make for ourselves. so in a sense that it is the path we choose for ourselves through the process of decision making, and that's what makes us us. we may have very different situations or encounters in our lives, but out life trajectory are not solely determined by what we were born with but also by our conscious decisions, which resemble the steering wheel in the driver's hands. these decisions define who we are and where we're going
	- we need and want to control over own lives. most of the time, we make decisions because we want things to be the way we want them to be. for instance you are discussing with what to have for dinner at a restaurant with your friend, you hate meat and your friend is a meal lover, apparently if you are the decision-maker you get to order what you want. so sometimes decision making is a way to maximize our own benefits.
