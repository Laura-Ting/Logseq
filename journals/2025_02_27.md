- consider multiple sensor modalities
- reason about object Dynamics and switching contacts
- think multiple steps in advance
- based on data
- information sources that robots can use to learn manipulation including human demonstrations, a simulation, the internet, previous skills and robot's own experiences
- challenges of manipulation is figuring out how to combine and balance between these different approaches to achieve data efficient learning
- what are the strengths and limitations of different types of learning approaches
- what are the specific challenges that manipulation poses to robot learning but also what are the unique opportunities that manipulation provides for learning
- how robot learning will provide robots with a robust and versatile manipulation skills needed to operate in complex environments
