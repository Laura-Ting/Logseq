- Subject: Inquiry about IELTS Retake Policy for Machine Learning Master's Program
- Dear Admissions Committee,
- I hope this message finds you well.
- I am writing to inquire about the English language proficiency requirements for the Machine Learning Master's program at the University of Tübingen. Specifically, I would like to know if the program accepts IELTS results with a retake component, where a candidate can submit their best scores from multiple attempts.
- My interest in your esteemed program stems from [briefly mention your academic or professional background and why you are interested in the program]. I am currently in the process of preparing my application and aiming to meet all the entry requirements, including the English language proficiency.
- I have taken the IELTS exam and, while I have achieved a satisfactory overall band score, I am slightly below the threshold in one particular section. I am planning to retake the specific section to meet the required score and was wondering if such a retake would be considered valid for your program's application.
- Could you please provide guidance on this matter? Your assistance would be greatly appreciated as it will help me in making informed decisions regarding my application.
- Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your prompt response.
- Warm regards,
- [Your Full Name]
